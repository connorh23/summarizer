      "All of the objects were removed illegally from the site and within a week were smuggled, agrees, which ran counter to his agreement with the Ottoman Turks after he was finished.",

      "B C and the site remain uninhabited For more than 200 years before a new settlement.",
      "Troy A. Was established around 700 BC as the ancient Greek city of Liliane and would be destroyed by the Romans during the civil wars in the first century B. C. It was then re founded as the Roman city of William in the twenties BC You may ask, What about the Trojan horse?",
      "Well, there has been speculation at the Trojan horse may have been a battering ram resembling a horse, and that the description of the use of this device was then transformed into a myth by later Orel historians who were not present at the battle and were unaware of that meaning of the name.",
      "Another interesting theory is that the Trojan horse was symbolic of Poseidon, God of the sea in earthquakes and whose favorite animal was the horse.",
      "Perhaps the Trojan horse was a thanks offering by the Greeks to beside for sending on earthquake to destroy the city's walls and allowing them to deliver the final blow.",
      "There's no way to prove if this is true, but it's interesting.",
      "Nonetheless.",
      "After piecing together the evidence with our modern understanding in the late Bronze Age, it appears likely that there was not one significant event but continual hostility for 2 to 3 centuries on the coastline between the Greeks and the non Greeks, an earthquake severely weakened the city of Lusa, and the Greeks relished the opportunity to plunder the once glorious settlement.",
      "It was not a grandiose 10 year war bringing about the annihilation of Troy.",
      "Certainly we must reject the scale of operations that Homer describes.",
      "But national epics are almost always based on actual events.",
      "However much they embellish should distort the details.",
      "So it is difficult to believe that the war or wars in this case was an entirely fictitious invention.",
      "It was possibly remembered by later Greeks, after all, while other operations in the 15th and 14th centuries BC were either for gotten or smudged together into the last clash because, as we're about to see, it was the last signal success of the Mycenaean civilization.",
      "According to legend, the Greek sacked Troy and returned back to grease laden with very rich booty.",
      "But what was presumably the height of their prosperity they suffered a fatal blow.",
      "They're standing as a regional power should have been made more secure after eliminating the Trojans.",
      "But as it turned out, the Trojans weren't the Greeks.",
      "Biggest threat.",
      "Archaeological evidence shows that in the mid 13th century, B. C. Thessaly and Bo Isha were under attack.",
      "Thieves and orca meanness were burned to the ground and a number of buildings surrounding the citadel of Mycenae or attacked and burned.",
      "These incidents appear to have triggered signs of stress and anxiety concerning the threat of another attack.",
      "There was a great increase in fortification alterations as the walls were being expanded bigger and longer in my seanie appearance in Athens.",
      "In addition, my senior interior it's built secret subterranean passages.",
      "Toe water supplies outside of the walls, suggesting that they were preparing for sieges and a wall was built across the isthmus of Korans were evidence remains of nearly two miles, although we aren't certain if it was completed or not.",
      "Linear B tablets from pilots refer to defense is by means of watchers on the coasts.",
      "But all of these defensive measures were in vain these disaster set off a series of events so severe that by the end of the 12th century BC, the Great Mycenaean civilisation was gone completely from historical record.",
      "The collapse of late Bronze Age Greece was actually part of a wider catastrophe that overwhelmed the entire eastern Mediterranean region and was even felt somewhat in the West.",
      "Scholar still disagree on what exactly happened because the evidence is very scanty.",
      "So many theories abound that try to explain the Bronze Age collapse both in Greece and in the greater Mediterranean as a whole.",
      "A common belief is that the Bronze Age World War Two depended on trade, and when issues started to arise, the entire system came crumbling down.",
      "Those said.",
      "Issues have been heavily debated, ranging from internal strife between local centres of power to some sort of economic breakdown possibly caused by earthquakes, climate change, drought, famine or a combination of all which put a stress on natural resource is in the north, possibly exacerbated by the Trojan war or wars, as it probably was, and the hit tights constant fighting with Egypt and Assyria.",
      "This, in turn caused many hungry peasants to leave their homes toe wander around the eastern Mediterranean to seek new places to live or to raid the shorelines in order to survive.",
      "Whatever the cause, these migrations of populations displaced other populations, leading to a wave of refugees and warrior bands spreading throughout the entire Mediterranean region, destroying political stability, economic prosperity, an international contact between the various civilizations.",
      "It's highly likely that the Ah ha wins from Anatolia and the Greek mainlanders were part of these refugees causing havoc in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "In fact, the attack on Troy seven a has been suggested by some to be a part of this, not a separate event.",
      "This period of disruption certainly lasted for decades, and in some areas it may have gone on much longer.",
      "As a rough generalization.",
      "It seems accurate to say that the period from roughly 12 50 to 10 50 BC saw numerous catastrophes for the various Mediterranean civilizations.",
      "The most informative records of this period are Egyptian hit tight and 11 time in 12 30 BC.",
      "The hit tights under to really of the fourth were defeated by two Colton in Arte and the Assyrians in the Battle of Nouria.",
      "The Assyrians were the rising power in the near East, and their victories significantly shifted the balance of power as hit Taipower began to wane.",
      "Following this defeat, another contemporary hit tight text reveals that hit tight vassal states were to prohibit ah Hollywood ships from reaching a Syrian controlled harbors as part of a trade embargo imposed on a Syria.",
      "The Utah wins and the Syrians weren't the only threats for the hit tights.",
      "As to Delia, the fourth felt the need to invade the island of Cypress, possibly because the island was being used as a launching off point for raids on the Anatolian coast line.",
      "Maybe it was the ah he all wins who had a large presence in Cyprus.",
      "Or maybe it was an early group of these refugees mentioned earlier.",
      "Or maybe Jahi.",
      "All wins were a part of this early refugee group.",
      "Regardless, the hit tights were victorious, and the island was a next.",
      "In 12 10 BC, The next hitchhiking should be alumina.",
      "Second had to fight off an invasion fleet coming from the direction of cypress, using 11 times ships, including a naval battle against Allah, Shia off the coast of cypress.",
      "The invasion and sell shows that the island, or at least part of it, was a staging ground for volatility.",

      "Although he was able to push them out, the hit tides did not share the same fate.",
      "Around the same time, the IT ites were assaulted in many of the cities in Anatolia were brought to heel hit.",
      "Tight records continue until 12 05 BC, and then their silence through archaeology and records of their neighbors, especially Ugur it.",
      "We know that the hit tight capital of Hot Tusa was sacked and destroyed.",
      "At this time.",
      "The likely culprits probably were the proto fridge Ian's, an Indo European tribe that had migrated from three so over the Bosphorous.",
      "The loss of the capital meant civilization disintegrated almost immediately in Anatolia, however, a smallish neo hit tight empire would emerge in the Iron Age world from car commish in northern Syria that would control some of southeastern Anatolia.",
      "They're rollers claim descent from the Untied Kings, moving into Syria and the northern Levant.",
      "The sea people soon sacked major Canaanite cities, including Ugarit, around 11 90 BC.",
      "Only a few coastal strongholds, notably bib loss inside on, were ableto whether the assault and emerge relatively unscathed.",
      "They would form the backbone of the Phoenician trading empire that we will touch upon more in future episodes, however, most in whether the attacks in the instance of Ugarit, the king reported, seen 20 warships off the coast and wrote a letter to the neighboring king of Allah, Shia on Cyprus that was baked him preserved in the fire that leveled Ugarit.",
      "That gives us insight on these invasions.",
      "Then all of the major cities of the southern Levante controlled by Egypt were also violently destroyed.",
      "Attacks on Egypt were repeated in 11 81 and 11 77 b. C. During the reign of the Ramseys, the third, although the Egyptians were able to stay the see people's off.",
      "The enormous effort and cost in doing so left Egypt a weekend and it would never fully recover its former power.",
      "The first way to approach these mysterious see people's is through their names found on the Egyptian record.",
      "Most of the names of their tribes are very suggestive.",
      "And they have been tentatively identified.",

      "Yes, it is believed that the Greeks had outgrown their raids on Anatolia and turned southwards to join up with these other displaced peoples.",
      "In any event, the so called see people's did not constitute a united population in any sense.",
      "Rather, they should be thought of as independent bands displaced by various political and economic troubles of their homeland.",
      "What evidence we have for the see people's points not toe one group spreading destruction across the eastern Mediterranean in a single title wave of violence, but rather to many despair.",
      "It bans a chain reaction of attacks and flights and a recurring and expanding cycle put even more bands of Raiders on the move.",
      "Some bands of sea peoples were perhaps made up exclusively of men conducting raids, who then expected to return to their homeland.",
      "Other groups of warriors and their families may have been looking for a new place to settle where they could live a more prosperous and secure life than in the disturbed area from which they had voluntarily departed or had been driven from by other Raiders.",
      "Any such people in flight could not expect a friendly welcome and foreign shores, and they had to be prepared to fight for their new homes.",
      "In the end, all of this fighting in motion redrew the political map of the Mediterranean and perhaps its population mapas well, although it is unclear how Maney groups actually resettled permanently at great distances from their original sites in this period, the Sea peoples weren't the main driving force of the late Bronze Age collapse as a whole, but it was a confluence of many factors.",
      "They seem to be both victims of these factors, and opportunists forced the seeking new home amidst the chaos.",
      "The reasons for all of this violent commotion is still mysterious in our present state of knowledge, but it had dire consequences for the Near East and Greece.",
      "The end of the Mycenaean civilisation happened in different stages.",
      "Pilots was destroyed by fire around 1200 BC, which presumably was when all of these linear B tablets were cooked and thus preserved.",
      "The sight of pilots would be abandoned and never resettled.",
      "However, there's no indication of an armed struggle like it.",
      "Troy.",
      "All we have are pottery clay tablets in a burn city.",
      "Linear B tablets list some 600 people to be levy Disservice.",
      "Rowers were left without definitive evidence, but it seems that it wasn't for military.",
      "Defense is but to evacuate the city.",
      "They torched their city loaded of their ships and got out of town around 11 92 11 80 BC my CD interior Unsworth felled by an earthquake.",
      "My senior was then reoccupied, but on a much smaller scale.",
      "But a second attack struck my senior around 11 50 BC, from which it did not recover.",
      "Terrence actually recovered and grew in size and population in the 12th century B C, possibly due to an influx of refugees.",
      "But by the end of the century, it too, had declined into a group of small villages surrounding the citadel.",
      "The places that were not destroyed were either completely abandoned or shrank drastically in size.",
      "As a result of this turmoil, specific regions in mainland grease witness a dramatic population decrease, especially Botia, the Argel, it and Macedonia.",
      "A lot of these displaced peoples probably migrated to Anatolia, Cyprus and 11 time coast to take part in the chaos and suing there, as was mentioned earlier.",
      "Nevertheless, other regions on the edge of the Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian Islands to the west, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands.",
      "Paradoxically, Athens lapsed into a collection of small villages around its Acropolis.",
      "Even though it's palace in town appears to have avoided destruction.",
      "The identity of the attacks on the Greek mainland remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of Greek history.",
      "An old theory on the collapse in the Mycenaean world centered on a movement of ethnic tribes who pressed into the Peloponnese from the north.",
      "This theory also is connected to the later Greek myth of the return of their hair.",
      "Clyde I, who were the exiled sons of Heracles, a mythical king of Terrance and the greatest of the Greek heroes, the Hera Clyde.",
      "I were expelled from the Peloponnese and returned 80 years after the Trojan War to reclaim Dominion over the territories their father had held in which they believed was their inheritance.",
      "So the theory is that they did, and thus they destroyed the palaces and conquer the region.",
      "However, a more modern view argues that an invasion came from Greek speaking tribes from the north who lived in the area of the pendants mountains and the pirates and Desole, meaning they were situated on the periphery of the Mycenaean world.",
      "But we're not really a part of it, since during the historical period, the Peloponnesian spoke a dialect of Greek called Doric.",
      "19th century scholars have referred to this event as the during invasion.",
      "In any event, as wave after wave port and agrees, they either killed off or pushed out the weekend Mycenae ends and set up shop in the abandoned lands.",
      "Some probably inter married and wiped out the aqui in language and culture and impose their own.",
      "Some scholars believe that the aqui ends may have been driven into the mountains as well, since the land on the northern side, the Peloponnese, is called a Kia.",
      "Also, there were people in the mountains of Arcadia who did not speak the Doric dialect.",
      "Further evidence given for a so called Dorian invasion is that there were new items after the collapse of Mycenaean culture.",
      "Iron weapons were used instead of bronze.",
      "Fibula pins were used to hold a cloak together.",
      "Also, the Mycenaean is buried, their dead, whereas these new people used to cremation.",
      "Thus, the belief was that the less civilised, tougher Dorian's were assisted by superior iron weapons and either killing the Akin's or driving them away and replaced their material culture with their own.",
      "However, there has been much modern dispute over this by those who believe that culture change can happen.",
      "In fact, without the population being replaced, the iron is now believed to have calm, not from the north.",
      "But the east.",
      "Cremation, instead of Berio, could have been due to impoverishment rather than new commerce.",
      "We should also expect to see a growth of population in the lands that became Dorian.",
      "But evidence suggests that in the Peloponnese there was a sharp decline in population.",
      "This is what I believe is the more likely explanation for the loss of this once glorious civilisation.",
      "With the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces, this near eastern type of social and economic organization would disappear forever from Greece.",
      "Yet in Egypt, in the Near East, which also suffered severe shocks themselves in the late Bronze Age, the ancient pattern of highly centralized, rigidly hierarchical monarchical states continued it.",
      "This is a good indication that underneath the veneer of great wealth and stability, the Mycenaean economy and government were shallowly rooted.",
      "Essentially fragile systems depended on others.",
      "The populations were growing so large, and Greece doesn't have much arable land, so they need a consistent source from the outside, which is fine when things were going well.",
      "But with the almost total interruption of Mediterranean commerce during and after the general chaos of the 13th century B C. This caused a fundamental breakdown in their way of life.",
      "It's certainly possible that this led to internal warfare among the kingdoms for what precious resource is were available, which could explain the destruction of some palaces.",
      "The eventual failure of the palace economies in their inability to recover had a devastating effect on the population at large, which was dependent on the system for a survival.",
      "The people desperate for food may have felt it necessary to join in these raiding parties going on along the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Famine and immigration could certainly have set the backdrop for a massive population drop in the 1100 b c, the Dorians or whatever you want to call them Saul a weekend and fractured Greece and use this opportunity to push southwards.",
      "The Dorians may have attacked the Mycenaean, or they may have not.",
      "Perhaps the coming of the Dorians was not really an evasion, but the filling of the political vacuum created by the obliteration of the Mycenaean Palace economy they impose on the Peloponnese but came down in waves of tribes over several centuries, not one large mass invasion.",
      "This would explain why some of the palaces didn't suffer physical damage but declined and stagnated just the same as those that had been burned to the ground, either by friendly or enemy fire.",
      "We will probably never know for certain why the Mycenaean civilization ended so abruptly and with such finality.",
      "But with the first stage of grief, civilization coming to a close.",
      "We now see the beginning of a new error so different that when the Greeks looked back upon their late Bronze Age past, they could only imagine it is a kind of mythical dreamworld, a time when gods and humans mingled together and heroes achieve superhuman feats.",
      "The memory of the Bronze Age is enshrined in two great epics, The Iliad and the Odyssey.",
      "But these two epics were written decades later by a mysterious, almost mythological man himself in Homer.",
      "On the next episode, we will dig deeper into these two famous epics that would essentially become the Bible for later Greeks.",
      "They give us an invaluable look into the Greek ethos.",
      "We will also address the Homeric question, which asks if Homer was even a real person.",
      "Was there a real world that Homer's poems refer to?",
      "If so, what world was it?",
      "Was it The Mycenaean Bronze Age was the post Mycenaean world?",
      "That's the seed of the Bronze Age that we call the dark age.",
